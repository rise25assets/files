WSL at IIITB is a part of the global WSTNet.\n\nThe “The Power Law of Information: Life in a Connected World” written in 2006 by Srinath Srinivasa provides some of the underlying questions that started this lab. This book was written before the emergence of social media, mobile apps, cryptocurrency, etc. and has some arguments speculating the emergence of these structures.\n\nAs part of our Digital Empowerment initiatives, WSL has also partnered with Gooru Learning Inc., which is California-based company (that has its genesis in Google Inc) focusing on how WWW and AI can aid in social empowerment through education.
